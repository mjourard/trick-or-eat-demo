The project is configured with the .gitignore to never checkin the file clsCreds.php

This is because clsCreds.php will likely be different from environment to environment, so it would 
always be changing.

Instead, create a clsCreds.php file from the provided clsCreds.php.example file and populate it with your credential information.
